  <p>
    I'm the nicest person I know. For the most part, I love myself, and I also love so many other people. My heart is huge and it tries to be kind -- always and equally kind -- across the entire spectrum of humanity. Yet, I still accept that some people simply don't like me. They don't like my passions, my voice, my perspectives, my ideas, my explorations, my outlook, my spiritual shifts or my soulful indulgences. Some people do not like my look; I actually have a pretty big nose - it's wide and it hooks. Plus, I was born with brown skin. I'm also fairly hairy. Hummmm, what else can I reveal within this pantry of vulnerability? Well, I'm very attracted to freckles and redheads: all redheads, all freckles. Once, perhaps twice in my life, I've been unfairly rejected for not being white. Now that hurt because it involved romantic love. Ugh! The confusion and pain! At the time, I knew deep down that someone loved me, but a family intervention negatively influenced our innocence. I learned early on how rejection sucks--rejection really sucks! Those days, months, and even years truly confused my heart. In fact, rejection created so much pain in me back then that it shifted me deeply into academic endeavors. I tried to become "better" by becoming smarter. And in a perverse way, it worked. I had thought that I was already rather intelligent, at least I used to be intelligent. Since childhood, I’ve always know that I was honest and charming, but in the early stages of my autonomy - as a postbaccalaureate - I attempted to become much more intelligent than I ever needed to be, and I did so in order to become accepted by a more "privileged" class of white folks. I’m Hispanic. Yet today, as I approach the half-century mark, I prefer to exercise mindful emptiness within my vesslel, forgetting all facts and dates, forgetting all algorithms and equations. I trust that my wisdom will arise if necessary or whenever I'm in a pickle, those difficult junctures in life. If my mind fails me, I can simply employ referencing tools, right?Dictionaries, Encyclopedias, Thesauri, Wikipedia, Mediation, Facebook (maybe not Facebook). Nothing is so important that a good almanac shouldn't leave me dumbfounded. What else? I've never purchased an automobile. My favorite color is orange. I like the sound of accordion music, and I even take accordion lessons. I love to write: particularly poetry. My best writings remain hidden, germinating until such time I complete my novel. I love run-on sentences and long paragraphs. I’m limited in understanding the language of emojis. I’ve resided in over 17 cities. I tend to organize well. I'm progressive and fair-minded. I've been in love twice, once with a woman and once a man. I'm not risk averse. I'm a "don't" player at craps; a good “don’t” payer. I can't lie. Plants love me. I'm very tactile, so I hug and touch people in order to establish genuine connectivity. Sadly, I’ve lived a rather celebate life, and even though I once owned a fine home and a few businesses, I've purged nearly all of my belongings. If it wasn’t for old journals and sentimental paperwork, I could probably fit my life into two suitcases. I use to be naive, then I became innocent, and now I'm aware; but I've never been hateful. At one crossroads, I practiced holiness and certainty. I served. I sang. I orated. Today, during my midlife crossroad, I'm more natural and ambiguous. No masters for me! No masters, that is, except love. Love overpowers my faculties. It wins. And actually, I'd like to retract my previous statement, wherein I claimed to lack any sense of hated; this isn’t quite true. I've often hated myself. Yep, self-hatred. Not to be confused with depression or sadness, self-hatred evolved from my internal dialog of inadequacy; it mired my soul... unnecessarily. There exists a fine line between love and hate, so it matters not which waters wash away my hopes and dreams. I’ve traversed many natural aqueducts. I’ve lived in many regions of the United States, on Madeira Island, Portugal, and I've travelled through ten different countries. I have celebrated multiculturalism throughout my life, because I love culture! Some folks hate culture and all of its richness, but I embrace it. I honestly do not understand ignorant people, yet I try to never reject them--I recon. Yes, I don't subscribe to ignorance, but neither do I reject it. Take tabloid journalism, or politics, or popular entertainment; overall, they unnaturally upstage our human spirit of compassion and giving.  These platforms are are extremely sophomoric, trite, and perhaps inflated with capitalistic illusions, but I don't hate them. And although I was once a vibrant, youthful athlete who twice won the Sacramento Metro league 110-meter high hurdle championship and captianed the varsity football team while dating the head cheerleader (I also followed the published statistics of professional athletes like a myopic capitalist follows commodity trading, I certainly don't care for professional sports anymore. Being a fanatic of professional sports used to sculpt the essence of my being, that is, until, well... I realized that my “essence” had nothing to do with with the commercial outside activities athletes, or of any other people really. So, I don't hate, and I'm the nicest person I know. I sing. I dance. I try to express joy, especially when I commune with nature; I love feeding birds, nurturing plants, and experiencing the three phases of water. I believe in quantum consciousness and the superposition of subatomic particles. I believe in quantum entanglement. I’m astounded by the murmuration of feathered foul and fish. Perhaps this is why I cannot stand to be alone. I’m not necessarily a follower, but I need people. I need to feel love and acceptance. Even so, some of my old friends and family still do not care for me as a person. It's true. I understand that my nature seems unstable or reckless, but I simply have wings: they must fly. I also have healthy feet, so I run towards life, not away from it. But I am not afraid to shift. When I fell out of first-love with a woman and fell into first-love with a man, some friends barked, "Hate the sin, love the sinner." When I discovered atheism for myself, alone and without outside influencers, and when I discovered my courageous voice against the contradictions of theism, monotheism in particular, some people asked me to stay away from their children, as if, I might add, that I would ever engage a child in philosophical discussions of mythology. People lost site of my innate goodness, calling me crazy or bipolar. But I know that this is untrue. Some friends felt the need to divorce themselves from my pure heart, the same heart that beat gloriously when I satisfied their images of me: alter boy, choir boy, a glorious singer of praises, as a "believer" and as a Roman Catholic. Today, when I distill my vulnerabilities, I feel fearless. I know that most people understand that I am gentle, and kind, and fair, and loving,and pure. I will continue to be the nicest person I know, and I will be more gentle and more loving to myself. As my narrative dissipates, I intend to take life one moment at a time. I am a good man. It is my responsibility to be good to others, especially to my family and friends.  I thank you for witnessing yet another attempt at me becoming more vulnerable.
