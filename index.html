        <h3>My Pantry Of Vulnerabilites</h3>
        
        <p title="My Pantry Of Vulnerabilities">
          August 2017<br>I'm the nicest person I know. For the most part, I love myself, and I also love so many other people. I love plants, animals, and nature. My heart is huge and it tries to be kind -- always and equally kind -- across the entire spectrum of humanity. Yet,having lived fully, I accept that a few people simply do not like me. These individuals don't like my passions, my voice, my perspectives, my ideas, my explorations, my outlook, my spiritual shifts or my soulful indulgences. It's our human condition. Some people do not like how another person looks; I actually have a pretty big nose - it's wide and it hooks. I'm also fairly hairy. Plus, I was born with brown skin. Hummmm, what else can I reveal within this pantry of vulnerability? Well... I'm very attracted to freckles and redheads: all redheads, all freckles! I possess neither red hair or freckles. Once, perhaps twice in my life, I've been unfairly rejected for not being white. That hurt me emotionally because it involved romantic love. Ugh! The confusion and pain! At the time, I knew deep down (in the pit of my soul) that someone special loved me, but her family intervention negatively influenced our youthful innocent relationship. I learned early on how rejection sucks - rejection really sucks! For days, months, and even years that romantic rejection truly confused my heart. In fact, rejection created so much pain in me that it shifted me deeply into academic endeavors. I tried to become "better" by becoming "smarter". And in a perverse way, it worked. I had thought that I was already rather intelligent; at least I used to be intelligent. I graduated from a Catholic grammar school,a Catholic high school, and a Catholic college. Since childhood, I’ve always know that I was an honest and and forthright and charming person, but in the early stages of my autonomy - as a post baccalaureate - I attempted to become much more intelligent than I ever needed to be, and I did so in order to become accepted by a more "privileged" class of white folks. I’m Hispanic. Today, as I approach the half-century mark, I prefer to exercise mindful emptiness within my soulful vessel, forgetting all facts and dates, forgetting all algorithms and equations, forgetting my past rejections. I trust that the wisdom within me will arise, if necessary, whenever I'm in a pickle, perhaps during one of those difficult junctures in life: death of a loved one, hope for the impossible, and an unforeseen downswing within the normal vicissitudes of life. If my mind fails me, I can simply employ referencing tools, right? - Dictionaries, Encyclopedias, Thesauri, Wikipedia,Meditation, Facebook (well...maybe not Facebook!). Nothing is so important that a good almanac shouldn't leave me dumbfounded. What else? What else can I reveal in my pantry of vulnerabilities. I've never purchased an automobile. My favorite color is orange. I like the sound of accordion music, and I actually take accordion lessons. I love to write: poetry in particular but particularly poetry. My best writings remain hidden, germinating until such time when I complete my first novel. <strong> I love run-on sentences and long paragraphs. </strong> I’m limited in my understanding of the language of emojis. As an adult, I’ve resided in over 17 cities and 6 states (but I've never been in the military). I abhor projectiles. I encourage exploration. I'm progressive and fair-minded. I tend to organize inanimate objects well. In fact, I enjoy organizing stuff. But I don't accumulate things; I prefer to purge. I've been in love twice, once with a woman and once a man. I'm not risk averse. I'm a "don't" player at craps - a good “don’t” payer! I can't lie. Plants love me. I'm very tactile, so I hug and touch people in order to establish genuine connectivity. Sadly, I’ve lived a rather celibate life, and even though I once owned a fine home and a few businesses, I've purged nearly all of my belongings. I'm clean. If it wasn’t for my old journals and some sentimental paperwork, I could probably fit my entire life into two suitcases. Nostalgia only beckons through music. I use to be innocent, then I became naive, and now I'm aware; but I've never been hateful. At an early and formative crossroad, I practiced holiness and certainty. I served. I sang. I orated. Today, however, during my midlife crossroad, I'm more natural and ambiguous. No masters for me, please! No masters, that is, except love. Love overpowers my faculties. It wins. And... actually, I'd like to retract my previous statement, wherein I claimed to lack any sense of hated. This isn’t quite true. I've often hated myself. Yep, self-hatred. Not to be confused with depression or sadness, self-hatred evolved from my internal dialogs of inadequacy; it mired my soul... unnecessarily. There exists a fine line between love and hate, so it matters not which waters wash away my hopes and dreams. I’ve traversed many natural aqueducts. I’ve lived in many regions of the United States, as well as Madeira Island, Portugal, and I've travelled through ten different countries. I have celebrated multiculturalism throughout my life, because I love culture! Some folks hate culture and all of its richness, but I embrace it. I honestly do not understand ignorant people, yet I rarely attempt to reject them; I recon. Yes, I don't subscribe to ignorance, but neither do I reject it. Since you've indulged my scripting thus far, take my stance on tabloid journalism, or partisan politics, or popular entertainment; overall, they unnaturally upstage the human spirit of compassion and giving. These platforms are extremely sophomoric, trite, and inflated with capitalistic illusions, but I don't hate them. And although I was once a vibrant, youthful athlete who twice won the Sacramento Metro League 110-meter high hurdle championship and once captained the varsity football team while dating the head cheerleader (shamelessly, I also used to indulge in the published statistics of professional athletic teams, the way a myopic capitalist follows commodities trading), but I certainly don't care for commercial sporting events anymore. In my misguided youth, being a fanatic fan of professional sports used to sculpt the essence of my being, that is, until, well... I realized that my “essence” had nothing to do with with the business activities of other people, especially the endeavors of professional athletes. So, I don't hate, and I'm the nicest person I know. I sing. I dance. I try to express my joy internally, especially when I commune with nature. I love feeding birds, nurturing plants, and experiencing the three phases of water. I believe in quantum consciousness and the superposition of subatomic particles. I believe in quantum entanglement. I’m astounded by the murmuration of starlings and fish. Perhaps my observation of nature is the reason I cannot withstand being alone. I’m not a follower, but I need people. I need to feel love and acceptance. Even so, some of my old friends and family still do not care for me as a person. It's true. I understand that my explorative nature seems unstable or reckless, but I simply have wings: they must fly. I also have healthy feet, so I run toward life, not away from it. I am not afraid to shift. When I finally fell out of "first-love" with a woman and fell into "first-love" with a man, some very dear friends barked at me: "Hate the sin, love the sinner." When I discovered atheism for myself - alone and without outside influencers - and when I discovered my courageous voice against the contradictions of theism (monotheism in particular) some people asked me to stay away from their children, as if, I might add, I would ever engage a child in philosophical discussions of mythology. Nonsense! When I shared my newfound awarenesses, many people lost site of my innate goodness, calling me crazy or bipolar. But I know very well that this is untrue (they also know this, quite well). Some family and friends felt the need to divorce themselves from my pure heart, the same heart that beat gloriously when I satisfied their images of me: Steve the alter boy, Steve the choir boy, Steve a glorious singer of praises as Steve the "believer" and Steve the Roman Catholic fulfilled their rigid narrative. I do not want to be confined by stories or narratives. Today, as I distill my personal vulnerabilities, I feel rather fearless. I know that most people understand me to be gentle and kind and fair and loving and pure. I will continue to be the nicest person that I know, and I vow to be even gentler and more loving to myself. As each day dissipates, I intend to take life one moment at a time. I am a good man. It is my responsibility to be good to others, especially to my family and friends. <em>I thank you for witnessing how I organize my pantry of vulnerabilities.</em>
