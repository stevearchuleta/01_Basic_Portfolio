              Upon my graduation from the University of California at Davis’ 24-week coding boot camp in June 2019, I have maintained -- DAILY and VIGOROUSLY –- the perseverance of my A- academic average while enhancing my programming, logic, and styling skills. By completely reexamining the aforementioned curriculum and coding activities, as well as refactoring my 26 gitHub repositories, I continue to hone the swell of proficiencies with which I tender this job application. In accordance with the requirements set forth by <em>YOUR COMPANY</em>, I herein submit this Statement of Qualification as an unordered table of my technological aptitudes, today, <em>DD MMM YYYY</em>.

                I approach the numerous intricacies of coding with care and humility. Insofar as the University of California boot camp developed my programming rigor with a demanding and fast-paced comprehensiveness, I bring to this particular qualifying statement a disciplined integration of testing and debugging. Having purposefully stepped into the arena of digital technology in order to reinvent myself, I feel confident in (and much more relevant with) our growing commercial dependency upon data distribution and consumption. In concordance with software development methodologies (including the usage of integrated terminals, IDEs, and advanced text editors), and being a former retail entrepreneur with over twenty (20) years of professional experience in building, operating, and designing three (3) brick-and-mortar boutiques, I am most keen on the timely delivery of goods and services. <em>YOUR COMPANY</em> shall benefit veritably through my well-focused diligence as I exercise a deep commitment to: 1) my technological determination within the collaborative configuration of web development, 2) my past business experience and academic acumen as it relates to writing, proofing, and editing, and 3) my current need to challenge myself as a junior developer and advance my contributions to best help the team.
            </p>
            <p title="Statement of Qualification">
                With foresight, I recognize that today’s systems of deliverables in both the public and private sectors are best propositioned amid the amiability of cohesive teamwork. My ability to communicate respectfully, to write articulately, and to edit sensitive content with a fair-minded and multicultural perspective shall assist a diverse body of end users in seamless navigation. I can also work independently, referencing internal and external documentation whereby, without prejudice, I interact responsibly with a consortium of active contributors. I hope to create and maintain ongoing relationships within this unified team, departmentally servicing an array of clients. <b>I also hope to learn and grow.</b> Amid the domain of software engineering, I shall wholeheartedly incorporate my nascent coding skills into the unfolding of fresh, interactive developments such that the use of interdisciplinary tools can appropriately render a host of interactive and secure consumer outreaches: simply, easily, and with clarity.

              <li><h5>Experience in Web Application Development</h5>
                <p>Since November 2018, the entire awareness of my life’s existence has been guided by the University of California at Davis’ 24-week web-development coding boot camp curriculum.  Daily, since graduation, I have continued to exercise the necessary logic and coding skills to pursue web application development. From <em>focusing my growing talents onto the precise fundamentals of dynamically building interactive apps</em> to<em> the further development of my other complex MERN stack activities and projects</em>, I continue to invested 6 to 10 hours every day to enhance the persistence of this life-transforming commitment. It wasn’t easy (and I continue to grow), but as a 51-year-old invigorated junior developer, I enjoy applying my steadfast work ethic to the broad spectrum of coding. Each component of every web application fuels my eagerness to learn more: building and debugging.</p>

              <li><h5>Experience with Open Data, Proprietary Data, and API Platforms:</h5>
                <p>
                    Although I have not embedded any complex financial maps or GIS frameworks into any of my early projects, I do have academic experience with various restful APIs. Through AJAX and/or Axios calls, I am familiar with the CDN for referencing the following web-based APIs: NY Times, Giphy, IMDb, Harvest Helper, and ET Water. I have no professional coding experience, however I've utilized the vast structured and non-strucutred query selectors within mySQL and MongoDB, respectively, for metadata retrieval within JSON objects. While I continue to learn to research, render, and deliver API visualization within web-based designs, I recognize how a proper utilization of open data, proprietary data, and API platforms can yield a story-telling narrative for company.

                  <h5>Approach to Working in Teams (Collaboration & Coordination):</h5>
                  <p>
                      Excellent teamwork requires excellent leadership within a structured cohort of diverse professionals. From team management to team membership, the appropriate skills of listening, echoing, questioning, and re-assuring can build a level of trust and cooperation that heightens the precision of execution within a well-defined scope. I subscribe to open and honest internal dialogs, while also expressing any vulnerabilities that might address uncertainty, doubt, or inadequacy. Within a file-sharing network, I adhere to a version control system that includes brief notations and clear comments. “Say what you mean and mean what you say.” Eye contact, honesty, articulation, and acknowledgement spring forth a goal-oriented communal satisfaction of both sharing and caring. Hard work benefits everyone greatly, especially when patience and good will is employed. I am a hard worker. I am a patient man. I am a good man. <em>I yearn to grow from and contribute to a cohesive team of technologists.</em> ☺

                  <h5>Effective Communication:</h5>
                  <p>
                      The maintenance of any good relationship or group interactivity is dependent upon the willingness of all parties to impart genuine presence and respect. A time-honored rubric of nonagressive communication is my personal accord for professional conveyance: skillful observation, as well as the basic intuitive sense for other people's feelings, their needs, and their requests. When listening, I often reassure others (and myself!) by echoing what I’ve heard, so that I might focus my efforts more efficiently and effectively. When I must pause -- to privately reference open source documentation in order to refresh my recollection and/or employ fundamental principles,I execute this detour as timely as possible, wholly prepared for followup or feedback. I am not afraid to ask my contemporaries for guidance or help. I like to be challenged,and although I'm not the brightest bulb in the community, I work hard. Through my wrtten and verbal communication, I aim for intellectual grown and expansion. As I learn and grow technically, I trust that my ability to contribute may propel me into senior management positions. Herein, I offer you my unparalleled work-ethic: first person to arrive in the morning, last person to leave at the end of the day. I try to be balanced, determined, and malleable.
